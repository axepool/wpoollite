You can CPU mine without it affecting your GPU performance. In task manager, details tab, right click the task (walton.exe)
and hit 'set affinity, uncheck one of the cores.

You need to have the walton wallet installed to run this miner. You can find this on teh waltonchain website. 
(the private keys etc dont matter as you wont be mining to it)

IMPORTANT: make sure the walton wallet is closed before you run the easyminer. The 'psuedo' pools address is:
0xde6ccd2b3de6761d223ff00fd99b0fec43a82cad and this should appear in the command prompt as well as the pubaddr text file.
